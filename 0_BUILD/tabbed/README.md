tabbed - generic tabbed interface
=================================
tabbed is a simple tabbed X window container.

Requirements
------------
In order to build tabbed you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
make

Usage
------------
I use tabbed to create tabs for [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/). See, e.g. `zatura_tab.sh`, adapted from [https://github.com/mtikekar/zathura-tabbed/blob/master/zathura-tabbed](https://github.com/mtikekar/zathura-tabbed/blob/master/zathura-tabbed) and modified to avoid duplicates and set icon (line 32 should be changed matching your setup)
